#Calculate the multiplication and sum of two numbers. Given two integer numbers return their product only if the product is greater than 1000, else return their sum.

def multiplication_or_sum(num1, num2):
    # calculate product of two numbers
    product = num1 * num2
    # check if product is less then 1000
    if product <= 1000:
        return product
    else:
        # product is greater than 1000 calculate sum
        return num1 + num2

# first condition
number1 = 20

# Second condition
number1 = 40
